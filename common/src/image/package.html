The code here has been borrowed over from different websites (which I do not remember now). 
SobelOperator and Gaussian2DFilter have been borrowed line by line from internet sources and just a bit of structuring has been changed.
Whoever wrote the original code has all the rights.
If you are aware of original authors, let me know, I will add their copyrights/names/credits etc.
